# OpenTK_Project

## An Opentk project with a lot already implemented

![](OpenTK/demo.png)

This project is already done and can serve as an example to build your own project.
What has already been done:
Asssimp is already implemented to load models, fonts can be loaded, a rendering framebuffer to create post-processing,
ImGui ready to use, PBR (Physically Based Renderin) techniques and environment reflection system, applied in the example model, A very conventional way to create CubeMaps
through rectangular images, some example shaders that can be very useful and some more meshes to create rectangles, spheres and cubes.

I hope this project is very useful for anyone to be able to deal with opentk, in the future I will implement new elements.
