# OpenTK_Project

## An Opentk project with a lot already implemented
__________

![](demo.png)

This project can be a good guide to help you implement some features
what has already been done:

* Asssimp is already implemented to load models.
* fonts can be loaded.
* A rendering framebuffer to create post-processing.
* ImGui ready to use. 
* Shader PBR (Physically Based Renderin) techniques and environment reflection system, applied in the example model.
* A very conventional way to create CubeMaps through rectangular images.
* Some example shaders that can be very useful.
* And some more meshes to create rectangles, spheres and cubes.

I hope this project is very useful for anyone to be able to deal with opentk, in the future I will implement new elements.
