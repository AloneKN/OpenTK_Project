This project can be a good guide to help you implement some features
what has already been done:

* Asssimp.
* Freetype for fonts.
* ImGui.
* Engine Bullet Physics.
* Shader PBR;
* Load various types of skyboxes.
* Bloom Effect.

I hope this project is very useful for anyone to be able to deal with opentk, in the future I will implement new elements.
